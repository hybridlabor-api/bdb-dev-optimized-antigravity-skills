## 🌟 144 Optimized Skills

We started with a massive pool of over 1,400 raw AI skills. After rigorous testing, filtering, and refinement, we’ve distilled them down to a hyper-curated set of **144 Optimized Skills** (featuring a native OpenWiki documentation engine in v1.3.3, and the **memB local semantic memory brain in v2.0.0**).

These skills are precision-engineered to ensure agents waste no time on redundant tasks and instead operate with maximum agency and context awareness.

### 💻 Beyond Events: Normal Software & App Coding
While heavily optimized for the creative tech industry, these skills are deeply rooted in core software engineering:
- **Full-Stack Development**: Spinning up Next.js App Router boilerplates, building scalable Node.js microservices, and crafting interactive frontends.
- **App Development**: Architecting databases, designing REST APIs, and building standard web and mobile applications from scratch.
- **Design & Quality Assurance**: Auditing UI/UX patterns (utilizing `ui-ux-pro-max`), enforcing clean code principles, and setting up strict CI/CD pipelines.

AI agents follow this structured lifecycle, deeply integrated with the **BDBrainstorm** and **BDBMediaStorm** philosophy:

- **1. IDEATE & MEDIA STORM (`/grill-me`, `/bdbrainstorm`, `/bdbmediastorm`)**: Actively challenge ideas or conduct multi-agent media/event-tech brainstorming. Spawns specialized subagents (CI/Design Expert, Real Time Architect, MCP Implementer) to validate hardware, 3D scenography (Rhino, Blender, Unreal), protocols (OSC, Art-Net), and MCP compatibility.
- **2. DEFINE & SCAFFOLD (`openwiki-skill`, `github-repo`)**: Confirm target workspace directory with the user, then autonomously initialize project documentation, `agent.md`, `.openwiki/` structures, and GitHub repo standards.
- **3. PLAN (`/plan`)**: Create technical design specs, PRD, and file-by-file implementation plans, strictly adhering to `ui-ux-pro-max` standards.
- **4. BUILD (`/subagents`)**: Subagent-driven development. The master orchestrator delegates specific component creation, node patching, and refactoring tasks to independent subagents.
- **5. VERIFY & REVIEW (`/review`)**: Perform QA gate reviews, secret scans, unit test suites, and strict UI/UX or signal-flow audits.
- **6. SHIP (`/ship`)**: Commit, push private repositories, update OpenWiki docs autonomously, and deploy live.

## 🌐 OpenWiki Native System

BDB OS v1.3.3 introduces a fully **Gemini-Native OpenWiki** engine designed to autonomously maintain codebase wikis, README entries, and release notes across all your active projects.

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 How It Works</strong></summary>

1. **No Node CLI Overhead:** Rather than utilizing an external Javascript engine and model API keys, the system runs inside your local Antigravity environment, leveraging the 1M+ context window of **Gemini 3.5 Flash** for free.
2. **Git Evidence Loop:** The daemon executes a sub-second Python helper ([openwiki_helper.py](skills/global_config/openwiki-skill/scripts/openwiki_helper.py)) to parse Git changes and unstaged diffs.
3. **Smart Updates:** If code changes are detected, it invokes the global `agy` CLI client in print-mode to update `.openwiki/` markdown pages and root entrypoints, then commits documentation updates separately using the prefix `docs(wiki): update project specs [auto]`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Setting Up the Background Daemon</strong></summary>

To ensure your project documentation never goes out of date, configure the background daemon:

#### On macOS (LaunchAgent)
```bash
bash ~/.gemini/config/skills/openwiki-skill/scripts/install_daemon.sh
```

#### On Windows (Task Scheduler)
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\config\skills\openwiki-skill\scripts\install_daemon.ps1"
```

#### For All Platforms: Register Projects & Monitor
**Register Projects:** Add absolute directory paths to your projects config file at `~/.openwiki/projects.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": [
    "/Users/<your-username>/bdb-dev-optimized-agent-skills",
    "/Users/<your-username>/Web-Projects/your-project"
  ],
  "interval_seconds": 3600
}
```
**Monitor Execution:** Tail the active logs to see background scan actions and documentation rebuild status:
```bash
tail -f ~/.openwiki/daemon.log
```
</details>

1. **Dynamic Flower Graph Layout:** Rather than utilizing hardcoded scopes, `memB` structures your memory into a flower-like layout:
   * **General Knowledge Hub (`category="godmode"`):** Stores universal preferences and developer specifications globally.
   * **Dynamic Project Leaves (`project_id="<current-directory-basename>"`):** The system dynamically resolves the active workspace directory name to segment and fetch project-specific learnings, preventing context pollution.
2. **Offline Vector Embeddings:** Bundles a pre-quantized 30MB `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX model and tokenizer. Vector calculations run locally in milliseconds.
3. **Data Sovereignty (Zero Telemetry):** Designed from the ground up to ensure absolute data sovereignty, with no remote logging, tracking, or analytics endpoints present in the codebase.
4. **Secret Filtration:** Blocks or redacts passwords, raw API keys, and connection strings prior to database injection.
