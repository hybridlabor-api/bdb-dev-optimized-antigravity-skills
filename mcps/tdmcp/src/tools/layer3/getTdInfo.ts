const DESCRIPTION =
  "Read-only health check + TouchDesigner server info. Returns {connected, endpoint, touchdesigner version info, knowledge-base stats, bridge_stale?} and changes nothing. Use this first to confirm the bridge is reachable; it succeeds even when TD is offline, reporting connected:false with the reason. Also warns when the running Python bridge is older than this build (a common gotcha — editing td/ doesn't reload the running bridge), pointing you at reload_bridge.";

/**
 * The bridge version this build of tdmcp ships (td/modules/utils/version.py). Keep in
 * sync with that file + package.json on every release. Used to warn when the *running*
 * bridge is stale relative to the source (the recurring "edited td/ but it didn't take"
 * gotcha) so a confusing class of failures gets a named, actionable message.
