# Deployment

How to ship `tdmcp` three ways: as a **Docker** container (HTTP
transport), as a **Claude Desktop Extension** (`.mcpb`, stdio), and to **npm**.

> **TouchDesigner is never containerized.** It always runs natively on the host
> with its Web Server DAT bridge listening on `127.0.0.1:9980` (see the repo
> `README.md` and `td/README.md` for the bridge setup). All deployment targets
> below are just different ways to run the *MCP server*, which then talks to
> that host-resident bridge over HTTP.

## 1. Docker / Docker Compose

In a container the server **must** use the HTTP transport. The default `stdio`
transport only works when the MCP client spawns the server as a local child
process; it cannot cross the container boundary. The image therefore defaults to
`TDMCP_TRANSPORT=http` on port `3939`, and reaches TouchDesigner on the host via
`host.docker.internal`.

### Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the `Dockerfile`, publishes `3939:3939`, and maps
`host.docker.internal` to the host gateway so the container can reach the
host-resident TouchDesigner bridge. Override the bridge location in the
`environment:` block of `docker-compose.yml` if TD listens elsewhere.

### Plain Docker

```bash
docker build -t tdmcp-server .
docker run --rm -p 3939:3939 \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e TDMCP_TD_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e TDMCP_TD_PORT=9980 \
  tdmcp-server
```

The MCP HTTP endpoint is then available on `http://localhost:3939`. Point an
HTTP-capable MCP client at it.

> **host.docker.internal notes.** On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) this name
> resolves automatically. On Linux you need the `--add-host` flag (plain Docker)
> or the `extra_hosts` entry (Compose) shown above. If TouchDesigner runs on a
> *different* machine, set `TDMCP_TD_HOST` to that machine's IP instead.

## 2. Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`)

Claude Desktop spawns the server locally, so the extension uses the **stdio**
transport (no `TDMCP_TRANSPORT` override needed). TouchDesigner still runs on the
same host; the extension exposes its host/port as user-configurable settings.

> `.mcpb` (MCP Bundle) is the current Desktop-extension format; it was previously
> called `.dxt`. Legacy `.dxt` bundles still install in Claude Desktop, but new
> builds ship `.mcpb`.

### Build the bundle

```bash
npm run build          # populate dist/ first
npm run build:mcpb     # (or: node scripts/build-dxt.mjs)
```

`build-dxt.mjs` uses the official packer when available and otherwise falls back
to a system `zip`. The packer was renamed from `@anthropic-ai/dxt` (CLI `dxt`,
format `.dxt`) to `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` (CLI `mcpb`, format `.mcpb`); the script
prefers `npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack` and falls back to the legacy
`@anthropic-ai/dxt`, then `zip`. (The legacy `dxt` CLI predates manifest spec 0.3
and rejects the `manifest_version` key, so install `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` to use the
official packer.) It writes `tdmcp.mcpb` to the repo root and prints install
instructions.

### Install

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings → Extensions**.
2. **Install from file** (or drag in) `tdmcp.mcpb`.
3. Set **TouchDesigner host/port** if they differ from the defaults
   (`127.0.0.1` : `9980`), then enable the extension.

The manifest lives at `dxt/manifest.json`. It declares a `node` server with
`entry_point: dist/index.js` and surfaces `TDMCP_TD_HOST`, `TDMCP_TD_PORT`,
`TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, `TDMCP_RAW_PYTHON`, and `TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE` via
`user_config`, injected into the server env as `${user_config.*}`.

---

## 3. Publish to npm

The package is public and published as the scoped npm package
`@dpantani/tdmcp`. The unscoped `tdmcp` name is blocked by npm's similarity
policy, so releases must stay on the scoped package.

```bash
npm run build
npm publish --access public
```

### Existing `package.json` release guards

- `prepublishOnly` guarantees a fresh build and a passing test suite run before
  anything is published.
- Scoped npm packages default to restricted access, so `publishConfig.access`
  and the manual command both keep the release public.
- The GitHub tag-release workflow publishes the `.mcpb` GitHub Release asset
  but leaves npm manual by default. It only auto-publishes npm when repository
  variable `TDMCP_AUTO_NPM_PUBLISH=true` and `NPM_TOKEN` are both configured.
