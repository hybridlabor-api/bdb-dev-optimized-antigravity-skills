# memB: Local Long-Term Memory Skill

This skill allows agents to access and maintain a persistent, offline-first long-term memory bank using the **`memb-mcp`** server. It manages user preferences, project structures, and complex developer workarounds.

## 🔒 Memory Safety & Secret Filtration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Secret Ingestion Rule:** Under no circumstances should raw credentials, passwords, API keys (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`), or raw environment configurations be written to memory. 
> Ensure all inputs are scrubbed of high-entropy strings before calling memory tools.

## 🛠️ Memory Categorization (Dynamic Flower-Like Graph Layout)

`memB` implements a dynamic, project-agnostic hierarchical layout that structures memories into clusters automatically without hardcoded categories:

1.  **"God Mode" / General Knowledge Hub (Center):**
    *   Mapped using **`category="godmode"`** (with `project_id=None`).
    *   Holds universal developer preferences, coding philosophies, global style sheets, and general core commands.
2.  **Dynamic Project Leaves (Petals):**
    *   Mapped using a specific **`project_id`** (e.g. `project_id="VisualSelect_By_BDB"` or `project_id="litha-gathering"`).
    *   Isolates facts, custom configurations, and files routing patterns to the specific workspace project, preventing context pollution.
    *   *System Integration:* The agent dynamically resolves the basename of the active workspace directory to scan and bind project memories automatically.

## 🔌 Using Memory Tools

When working on tasks, query memory at the start of your turn to retrieve relevant developer context, and add critical decisions at the end.

### 1. Ingestion (`add_memory`)
Use `add_memory` to commit a new fact, style preference, or design decision.
*   **Args:** `text` (string), `user_id` (string, default: "bdb_developer"), `category` (string, default: "godmode"), `project_id` (string, optional)
*   **Usage Guidelines:**
    *   *General Preferences:* "Alice prefers to use absolute import paths globally." -> `add_memory({ text: "Prefers absolute import paths globally", category: "godmode" })`
    *   *Project Learned Facts:* "In project VisualSelect, we must bypass the Firebase Auth login on localhost." -> `add_memory({ text: "Bypass Firebase Auth login on localhost", category: "project_node", project_id: "VisualSelect_By_BDB" })`

### 2. Retrieval (`search_memory`)
Use `search_memory` at the beginning of a task to load context.
*   **Args:** `query` (string), `user_id` (string), `limit` (integer), `project_id` (string, optional)
*   **Behavior:** The search queries both global `godmode` memory and the active `project_id` memory in parallel, merging and ranking results by similarity.

### 3. Cleanup & Auditing (`list_memories` / `delete_memory`)
*   Use `list_memories` to audit active records.
*   Use `delete_memory` with a UUID to remove outdated or erroneous facts.

## 🚨 CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: AI-FIRST VAULT NAVIGATION 🚨

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT use arbitrary `find`, `ls -R`, or arbitrary file searches to discover project architecture!**
> The `memB` ecosystem natively maintains a physical **AI-First Vault** at `~/.MemBDB/memB_Vault/`.
> 1. **Always read `~/.MemBDB/memB_Vault/God_Mode.md` FIRST** to understand the ecosystem topology.
> 2. Navigate the tree via the `_Hub.md` files.
> 3. Only search the actual workspace filesystem for raw code editing once you know the exact file path.

## 🧠 Agentic Ingestion (Intelligent Vault Building)

You are responsible for intelligently categorized ingestion. Do NOT rely on static rules. When asked to ingest a project into memB:
1. **Analyze the Target:** Briefly scan the target directory to understand the project's purpose (e.g. 3D WebGL site, Python API, React Native app).
2. **Design Semantic Categories:** Dynamically invent highly precise categories tailored to the project (e.g., `3D_Engine`, `Routing_Logic`, `Database_Schemas`, `Styling_System`).
3. **Targeted Ingestion:** Execute the Python ingestion tool explicitly for specific files and categories, rather than doing a blind root scan. 

**Execution:**
Use the `run_command` tool to execute `memb_ingest.py` on specific files or folders, explicitly passing the `--project` and `--category` flags.
```bash
/Users/timrennings/.gemini/mcps/memb-mcp/.venv/bin/python /Users/timrennings/bdb-dev/bdb-dev-optimized-agent-skills/mcps/memb-mcp/memb_ingest.py path/to/specific_file.md --project "MyProject" --category "3D_Engine"
```
*(By injecting files one-by-one or in smart batches with precise categories, you build a flawless physical AI Vault that other agents can navigate intuitively).*

## 🚀 Micro-Targeted RAG (Task Execution)

1.  **Task Start (Context Loading):** If `God_Mode.md` shows the project exists, read its Hubs. If you need highly specific snippets, use the `search_memory` MCP tool to query the vector DB.
2.  **Execution:** Proceed with coding, applying the retrieved styles and preferences.
3.  **Task End (Knowledge Capture):** If you resolved a complex setup bug or the user specified a new preference, run `add_memory` to persist it.
